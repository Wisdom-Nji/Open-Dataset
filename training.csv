"Psychoanalytic psychotherapy
",statements
"There are different forms of psychoanalysis and psychotherapies in which psychoanalytic thinking is practiced.
",statements
"Besides classical psychoanalysis there is for example psychoanalytic psychotherapy, a therapeutic approach which widens ""the accessibility of psychoanalytic theory and clinical practices that had evolved over 100 plus years to a larger number of individuals."" Other examples of well known therapies which also use insights of psychoanalysis are mentalization-based treatment (MBT), and transference focused psychotherapy (TFP).

",statements
"Research
",statements
"Over a hundred years of case reports and studies in the journal Modern Psychoanalysis, the Psychoanalytic Quarterly, the International Journal of Psychoanalysis and the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association have analyzed the efficacy of analysis in cases of neurosis and character or personality problems.
",statements
"Psychoanalysis modified by object relations techniques has been shown to be effective in many cases of ingrained problems of intimacy and relationship (cf.
",statements
"the many books of Otto Kernberg).
",statements
"Psychoanalytic treatment, in other situations, may run from about a year to many years, depending on the severity and complexity of the pathology.
",statements
"Psychoanalytic theory has, from its inception, been the subject of criticism and controversy.
",statements
"Freud remarked on this early in his career, when other physicians in Vienna ostracized him for his findings that hysterical conversion symptoms were not limited to women.
",statements
"Challenges to analytic theory began with Otto Rank and Alfred Adler (turn of the 20th century), continued with behaviorists (e.g.
",statements
"Wolpe) into the 1940s and '50s, and have persisted (e.g.

"Miller).

"Criticisms come from those who object to the notion that there are mechanisms, thoughts or feelings in the mind that could be unconscious.
",statements
"Criticisms also have been leveled against the idea of ""infantile sexuality"" (the recognition that children between ages two and six imagine things about procreation).
",statements
"Criticisms of theory have led to variations in analytic theories, such as the work of Ronald Fairbairn, Michael Balint, and John Bowlby.

"In the past 30 years or so, the criticisms have centered on the issue of empirical verification.

"Psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development (cf.

"In the 1960s, Freud's early (1905) thoughts on the childhood development of female sexuality were challenged; this challenge led to major research in the 1970s and 80s, and then to a reformulation of female sexual development that corrected some of Freud's concepts.

"Effectiveness
",statements
"The psychoanalytic profession has been resistant to researching efficacy.
",statements
"Evaluations of effectiveness based on the interpretation of the therapist alone cannot be proven.
",statements
"Research results
",statements
"Meta-analyses in 2012 and 2013 found support or evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalytic therapy, thus further research is needed.
",statements
"Other meta-analyses published in the recent years showed psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy to be effective, with outcomes comparable or greater than other kinds of psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs, but these arguments have also been subjected to various criticisms.
",statements
"In particular, the inclusion of pre/post studies rather than randomized controlled trials, and the absence of adequate comparisons with control treatments is a serious limitation in interpreting the results.
",statements
"In 2011, the American Psychological Association made 103 comparisons between psychodynamic treatment and a non-dynamic competitor and found that 6 were superior, 5 were inferior, 28 had no difference and 63 were adequate.

"According to a 2004 French review conducted by INSERM, psychoanalysis was presumed or proven effective at treating panic disorder, post-traumatic stress, and personality disorders, but did not find evidence of its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia, bulimia and anorexia.

"Criticism
",statements
"As a field of science
",statements
"The strongest reason for considering Freud a pseudo-scientist is that he claimed to have tested – and thus to have provided the most cogent grounds for accepting – theories which are either untestable or even if testable had not been tested.
",statements
"It is spurious claims to have tested an untestable or untested theory which are the most pertinent grounds for deeming Freud and his followers pseudoscientists...
",statements
"—Frank Cioffi
",statements
"Both Freud and psychoanalysis have been criticized in extreme terms.
",statements
"Exchanges between critics and defenders of psychoanalysis have often been so heated that they have come to be characterized as the Freud Wars.
",statements
"Early critics of psychoanalysis believed that its theories were based too little on quantitative and experimental research, and too much on the clinical case study method.
",statements
"Some have accused Freud of fabrication, most famously in the case of Anna O.
",statements
"Philosopher Frank Cioffi cites false claims of a sound scientific verification of the theory and its elements as the strongest basis for classifying the work of Freud and his school as pseudoscience.
",statements
"Others have speculated that patients suffered from now easily identifiable conditions unrelated to psychoanalysis; for instance, Anna O.
",statements
"is thought to have suffered from an organic impairment such as tuberculous meningitis or temporal lobe epilepsy and not hysteria (see modern interpretations).
",statements
"Karl Popper argued that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience because its claims are not testable and cannot be refuted; that is, they are not falsifiable:
",statements
"....those ""clinical observations"" which analysts naively believe confirm their theory cannot do this any more than the daily confirmations which astrologers find in their practice.
",statements
"And as for Freud's epic of the Ego, the Super-ego, and the Id, no substantially stronger claim to scientific status can be made for it than for Homer's collected stories from the Olympus.
",statements
"In addition, Imre Lakatos wrote that ""Freudians have been nonplussed by Popper's basic challenge concerning scientific honesty.
",statements
"Indeed, they have refused to specify experimental conditions under which they would give up their basic assumptions."" In Sexual Desire (1986), philosopher Roger Scruton rejects Popper's arguments pointing to the theory of repression as an example of a Freudian theory that does have testable consequences.
",statements
"Scruton nevertheless concluded that psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific, on the grounds that it involves an unacceptable dependence on metaphor.
",statements
"The philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge argued that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience because it violates the ontology and methodology inherent to science.
",statements
"According to Bunge, most psychoanalytic theories are either untestable or unsupported by evidence.
",statements
"Cognitive scientists, in particular, have also weighed in.
",statements
"Martin Seligman, a prominent academic in positive psychology wrote that:
",statements
"Thirty years ago, the cognitive revolution in psychology overthrew both Freud and the behaviorists, at least in academia.… hinking…is not just a  of emotion or behavior.… motion is always generated by cognition, not the other way around.
",statements
"Linguist Noam Chomsky has criticized psychoanalysis for lacking a scientific basis.
",statements
"Steven Pinker considers Freudian theory unscientific for understanding the mind.
",statements
"Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould considered psychoanalysis influenced by pseudoscientific theories such as recapitulation theory.
",statements
"Psychologists Hans Eysenck (1985) and John F.
",statements
"Kihlstrom (2012/2000) have also criticized the field as pseudoscience.

"Adolf Grünbaum argues in Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (1993) that psychoanalytic based theories are falsifiable, but that the causal claims of psychoanalysis are unsupported by the available clinical evidence.
